## EATS

This website aims to provide the results of the experiments described in the paper "Generating reduced tests for FSMs using asearch-based testing approach" submitted to ICTAI 2019. The paper proposes the EATS method, a search-based software testing method for test suite generation from FSM. The objective of EATS is to generate test suites that represent a good trade-off between its cost and its fault coverage.

### Behaviour of EATS and literature methods varying the number of states, inputs and outputs
