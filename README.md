## EATS

This website aims to provide the data and charts of the experiments described in the paper "Generating reduced tests for FSMs using asearch-based testing approach" submitted to ICTAI 2019. This paper proposes the EATS method, a search-based software testing method for test suite generation from FSM. The objective of EATS is to generate test suites that represent a good trade-off between its cost and its fault coverage.
